Notes / Acknowledgements

This project was developed as a full-stack stock trading simulator with real stock data and a virtual account system. Core backend functionality, including user authentication, JWT-based login, and MongoDB integration, was developed with guidance from AI-assisted tools (ChatGPT).

All code was integrated, customized, and tested by the developer, including:

Designing database schemas for users and portfolios

Implementing signup/login endpoints with secure password hashing

Configuring JWT authentication for session management

Connecting to MongoDB Atlas and setting up environment variables

Testing API routes and verifying functionality

This approach demonstrates the ability to leverage modern AI tools responsibly while fully understanding, modifying, and deploying the resulting code. The project reflects hands-on experience with backend architecture, full-stack development, and real-time data integration.
